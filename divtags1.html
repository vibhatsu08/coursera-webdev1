        <h1>What is the difference between DIV tags and SPAN tags in HTML?</h1>
        <p>The only difference between Div tags and Span tags in html is that, div tags are used for styling 
            outline/outer-block elements. Whereas span tags are used to style the inline/inner-block elements.
